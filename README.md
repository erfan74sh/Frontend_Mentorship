### -[Challenge 01-Travel with us landing page](frontend-mentorship-challenge-01)

**A landing page of an pre-designed website in tourism industry**. This page was created with HTML nad SASS.
A good practic for challenging my skills in making the page responsive especially with many images in it.
I also use a little bit of JS for making like image feature.

### -[Challenge 02-Create-account form](frontend-mentorship-challenge-02)

**A create account form** that done with SASS and HTML. this simple form didn't challenge me on making it responsive but there were some challenges in customize the style of radio buttons and checkbox indicators. Also it was tough to deal with various styles of date inputs on browsers.
